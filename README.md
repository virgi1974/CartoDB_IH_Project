# IH_Map_Platform_Project

Web App based on customized maps.

First part of the project was done by scrapping data through several web pages in order to get .csv files 
with all the info related to UFO sigthings in USA since info recorded.

Second part of the project was to import the .csv files to CartoDb platform.

Third part of the project was the construction of the web app, by using the CartoDb JS Api`s to query the tables 
so I was able to customize my data visualization through Sql.
